# MCQ Quiz App

This is a simple quiz application built using **React** and **Material-UI**. The app allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, provides feedback on their responses, and shows their overall score at the end.

## Features

- Responsive design with Material-UI components
- Quiz progress is tracked with a progress bar
- Feedback on whether the answer is correct or incorrect
- Option to restart the quiz at the end
- Custom themes using Material-UI's `ThemeProvider`

## Demo

The app contains a series of questions where the user selects one answer from a list of options. Upon submission, feedback is shown indicating if the answer was correct. Users can then proceed to the next question. Once all questions are answered, the score is displayed along with an option to restart the quiz.


## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Material-UI**: React component library for UI elements and styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Main programming language used for logic and state management.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quiz-app.git
   cd quiz-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Customization

You can easily add more questions to the quiz by modifying the `questions` array in the `App.js` file. Each question object should contain the following fields:

- `question`: The question to be displayed
- `options`: An array of possible answers
- `correctAnswer`: The correct answer string

Example:

```javascript
const questions = [
  {
    question: "What is the capital of France?",
    options: ["London", "Berlin", "Paris", "Madrid"],
    correctAnswer: "Paris"
  },
  {
    question: "Which planet is known as the Red Planet?",
    options: ["Mars", "Jupiter", "Venus", "Saturn"],
    correctAnswer: "Mars"
  }
];
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add timer functionality for each question.
- Store quiz scores in local storage to track user progress.
- Add support for more types of questions (e.g., true/false, multiple correct answers).
- Implement a backend to track user scores and quiz history.
